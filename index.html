            <p class="first_text">Grand Theft Auto is a series of action-adventure games created by David Jones and Mike
                Dailly.[2] Later
                titles were developed under the oversight of brothers Dan and Sam Houser, Leslie Benzies and Aaron
                Garbut. It is primarily developed by British development house Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), and
                published by its American parent company, Rockstar Games. The name of the series is a term for motor
                vehicle theft in the United States.

                Gameplay focuses on an open world where the player can complete missions to progress an overall story,
                as well as engage in various side activities. Most of the gameplay revolves around driving and shooting,
                with occasional role-playing and stealth elements. The series also has elements of the earlier beat 'em
                up games from the 16-bit era. The games in the Grand Theft Auto series are set in fictional locales
                modelled after real-life cities, at various points in time from the early 1960s to the 2010s. The
                original game's map encompassed three cities—Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based
                on San Francisco),[a] and Vice City (based on Miami)—but later titles tend to focus on a single setting
                and expand upon the original three locales. Each game in the series centres on different respective
                protagonist who attempts to rise through the criminal underworld due to various motives, often
                accompanying themes of betrayal. Several film and music veterans have voiced characters in the games,
                including Ray Liotta, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, William Fichtner, James Woods, Debbie Harry, Axl
                Rose and Peter Fonda.[3]

                DMA Design began the series in 1997, with the release of the Grand Theft Auto. As of 2020, the series
                consists of seven standalone titles and four expansion packs. The third main title, Grand Theft Auto
                III, released in 2001, is considered a landmark game, and brought the series into a three-dimensional
                environment for the first time. Subsequent titles have followed and built upon the format established by
                Grand Theft Auto III, receiving significant acclaim. The games influenced other open-world games, and
                led to the label Grand Theft Auto clone on similar titles.[4]

                The series has been critically acclaimed, with all the main 3D entries in the franchise frequently
                ranked among the greatest and best-selling video games;[5] it has shipped more than 405 million units,
                making it one of the best-selling video game franchises. In 2006, Grand Theft Auto was featured in a
                list of British design icons in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design
                Museum.[6] In 2013, The Telegraph ranked Grand Theft Auto among Britain's most successful exports.[7]
                The series has also been controversial for its adult nature and violent themes, as well as for cut
                content.</p>

                <h1>Grand Theft Auto San Andreas</h1>
            </span>
            <p class="new_text">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a 2004 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar
                North and published by
                Rockstar Games. It is the fifth main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2002's Grand Theft
                Auto: Vice City, and the seventh installment overall. It was released in October 2004 for the
                PlayStation 2,
                in June 2005 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox, and in November 2010 for Mac OS X.[2][3] The game is set
                within
                an open world environment that players can explore and interact with at their leisure. The story follows
                Carl "CJ" Johnson, who returns home following his mother's murder and is drawn back into his former gang
                and
                a life of crime while clashing with corrupt authorities and powerful criminals. Carl's journey takes him
                across the fictional U.S. state of San Andreas, which is based on California and Nevada and encompasses
                three major cities: Los Santos (inspired by Los Angeles), San Fierro (San Francisco) and Las Venturas
                (Las
                Vegas).[b]

                The game features references to many real-life elements of the world, such as its cities, regions, and
                landmarks, with its plot heavily based on several real-life events in Los Angeles in the early 1990s,
                including the rivalry between street gangs, the crack epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s, the LAPD
                Rampart scandal, and the 1992 Los Angeles riots. San Andreas introduced gameplay elements that were
                incorporated in later games, including role-playing-style mechanics, customisation options with both
                clothing and vehicle appearances, a vast array of activities and mini-games, and the inclusion of
                gambling
                games.

                Considered by many reviewers to be one of the greatest video games ever made, San Andreas received
                critical
                acclaim upon release, with praise directed at its music, story and gameplay, and criticism for its
                graphics
                and some aspects of its controls. It was the best-selling video game of 2004, and with over 27.5 million
                copies sold worldwide as of 2011, it is the best-selling PlayStation 2 game and one of the best-selling
                video games of all time.[5] Like its predecessors, San Andreas is cited as a landmark in video games for
                its
                far-reaching influence within the industry. The game's violence and sexual content was the source of
                much
                public concern and controversy. In particular, a player-made software patch, dubbed the "Hot Coffee
                mod",
                unlocked a previously hidden sexual scene, resulting in the game being re-rated AO by the North American
                Entertainment Software Rating Board (although its previous M rating was reinstated after the game was
                edited
                to remove the content). A remastered version of the game was released for Android and iOS in 2013,[6]
                for
                Windows Phone, Fire OS and Xbox 360 in 2014, and for PlayStation 3 in 2015.[7] In June 2018, the game
                was
                made available for the Xbox One via backward compatibility. An enhanced version with the subtitle The
                Definitive Edition was released in 2021, and a virtual reality version for Oculus Quest 2 is in
                development.
                The next main entry in the series, Grand Theft Auto IV, was released in April 2008.

            <p class="vice11">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a 2002 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North
                and published by
                Rockstar Games. It is the fourth main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2001's Grand Theft
                Auto III, and the sixth instalment overall. Set in 1986 within the fictional Vice City (based on Miami
                and Miami Beach), the single-player story follows mobster Tommy Vercetti's rise to power after being
                released from prison and becoming caught up in an ambushed drug deal. While seeking out those
                responsible, he gradually builds a criminal empire by seizing power from other criminal organisations in
                the city.

                The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The
                open world design lets the player freely roam Vice City, consisting of two main islands. The game's plot
                is based on multiple real-world people and events in Miami such as Cubans, Haitians, and biker gangs,
                the 1980s crack epidemic, the Mafioso drug lords of Miami, and the dominance of glam metal. The game was
                also influenced by the films and television of the era, most notably Scarface and Miami Vice. Much of
                the development work constituted creating the game world to fit the inspiration and time period; the
                development team conducted extensive field research in Miami while creating the world. Grand Theft Auto:
                Vice City was released in October 2002 for the PlayStation 2, in May 2003 for Windows, and in October
                2003 for the Xbox.

                Upon its release, Vice City received critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at its music,
                gameplay, story, and open world design. However, the game also generated controversy over its depiction
                of violence and racial groups, sparking lawsuits and protests. Vice City became the best-selling video
                game of 2002 and has sold over 17.5 million copies. Considered one of the most significant titles of the
                sixth generation of video games and one of the greatest video games ever made, it won numerous year-end
                accolades including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications.

                Since its release, the game has received numerous ports to many gaming platforms. An enhanced version
                was released for mobile platforms in 2012 for the game's tenth anniversary, and a further enhanced
                version was released in 2021. Its successor, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, was released in October
                2004, and a prequel, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories, was released in October 2006.</p>

            <p>Grand Theft Auto III is a 2001 action-adventure game developed by DMA Design and published by Rockstar
                Games. It is the third main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 1999's Grand Theft Auto 2,
                and the fifth instalment overall. Set within the fictional Liberty City (loosely based on New York
                City), the story follows Claude, a silent protagonist who, after being betrayed and left for dead by his
                girlfriend during a robbery, embarks on a quest for revenge that leads him to become entangled in a
                world of crime, drugs, gang warfare, and corruption. The game is played from a third-person perspective
                and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. Its open world design lets players freely roam Liberty
                City, consisting of three main areas.

                Development was shared between DMA Design, based in Edinburgh, and Rockstar, based in New York City.
                Much of the development involved transforming popular elements from the Grand Theft Auto series into a
                fully 3D world for the first time. The game was delayed following the September 11 attacks to allow the
                team to change references and gameplay deemed inappropriate. Grand Theft Auto III was released in
                October 2001 for the PlayStation 2, in May 2002 for Windows, and in October 2003 for the Xbox.

                Grand Theft Auto III received critical acclaim, with particular praise directed at its concept and
                gameplay. However, it also generated controversy, with criticism directed at its depictions of violence
                and sex. It became the best-selling video game of 2001, and sold over 14.5 million copies by March 2008.
                Considered by many critics as one of the most significant titles of the sixth generation of video games
                and a landmark game in the open world concept, it is often listed among the greatest video games. It won
                several year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications.

                Since its release, it has received ports to many different gaming platforms. An enhanced version of the
                game was released on mobile platforms in 2011 for the game's tenth anniversary, and a further enhanced
                version for the twentieth anniversary was released in 2021. The game was followed by 2002's Grand Theft
                Auto: Vice City, while two prequels, Grand Theft Auto Advance and Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City
                Stories, were released in 2004 and 2005, respectively.

                Grand theft auto IV
            </span>

            <p>Grand Theft Auto IV is a 2008 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar
                Games. It is the sixth main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San
                Andreas, and the eleventh instalment overall. Set in the fictional Liberty City, based on New York City,
                the single-player story follows Eastern European war veteran Niko Bellic and his attempts to escape his
                past while under pressure from high-profile criminals. The open world design lets players freely roam
                Liberty City, consisting of three main islands, and the neighbouring state of Alderney, which is based
                on New Jersey.

                The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on foot and by vehicle.
                Throughout the single-player mode, players control Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is also
                included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both cooperative and competitive gameplay
                in a recreation of the single-player setting.[b] Two expansion packs were later released for the game,
                The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected
                with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists.

                Development of Grand Theft Auto IV began soon after the release of San Andreas and was shared between
                many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The game introduced a shift to a more realistic and detailed style
                and tone for the series. Unlike previous entries, Grand Theft Auto IV lacked a strong cinematic
                influence, as the team attempted an original approach to the story. As part of their research for the
                open world, the development team conducted extensive field research in New York, capturing over 100,000
                photographs and several hours of video. The developers considered the world to be the most important
                element of the game; though not the largest map in the series, they considered it comparable in scope
                due to its verticality and level of detail. The budget climbed to over US$100 million, making it one of
                the most expensive video games to develop.

                Grand Theft Auto IV was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in April 2008, and for
                Windows in December. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed
                at the narrative and open-world design. Grand Theft Auto IV broke industry sales records and became the
                fastest-selling entertainment product in history at the time, earning US$310 million in its first day
                and US$500 million in its first week. Considered one of the most significant titles of the seventh
                generation of video games, and by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time, it won
                year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. It is among the
                best-selling video games with over 25 million copies sold by 2013. The game generated controversy, with
                criticism directed at the game's depiction of violence and players' ability to drink-drive. Its
                successor, Grand Theft Auto V, was released in September 2013.

Grand theft auto V
            </span>
            <p>
                Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar
                Games. It is the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto
                IV, and the fifteenth instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on
                Southern California, the single-player story follows three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De
                Santa, street gangster Franklin Clinton, and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips—and their attempts
                to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. Players
                freely roam San Andreas's open world countryside and fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.

                The game world is navigated on foot and by vehicle, from either a third-person or first-person
                perspective. Players control the protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both
                during and outside missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve
                shooting and driving gameplay. A "wanted" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to
                players who commit crimes. In Grand Theft Auto Online, the game's online multiplayer mode, up to 30
                players engage in a variety of different cooperative and competitive game modes.

                Shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide, the game's development began around the time of
                Grand Theft Auto IV's release. The developers drew influence from many of their previous projects (such
                as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3) and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate
                on the core structure of its predecessors. Much of the development work constituted the open world's
                creation, and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the
                design team. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed by a team of producers who
                collaborated over several years. Grand Theft Auto V was released in September 2013 for the PlayStation 3
                and Xbox 360, in November 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, in April 2015 for Windows, and in
                March 2022 for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

                Extensively marketed and widely anticipated, the game broke industry sales records and became the
                fastest-selling entertainment product in history, earning $800 million in its first day and $1 billion
                in its first three days. Critics acclaimed its multiple-protagonist design, open world, presentation and
                gameplay. However, its depiction of violence and women caused controversies. Several gaming publications
                awarded the game year-end accolades including Game of the Year awards. In retrospect, it is considered
                one of seventh and eighth generation console gaming's most significant titles and among the best video
